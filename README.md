# Earthquake Pattern Clustering in Japan

## Overview

This project explores **21,000+ historical earthquakes around Japan** to uncover
spatial and temporal patterns that matter for disaster‑prevention research.

- Cleaned and enriched raw USGS data (datetime parsing, missing‑value handling).
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (magnitude, depth, yearly trend).
- Applied **K‑Means clustering** (k = 4) to reveal seismic zones aligning with the four major tectonic plates.
- Built an **interactive Folium map** of high‑magnitude (M ≥ 6) events.
